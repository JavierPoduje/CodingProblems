# Amstrong Numbers

**Dificult**: easy

## Instructions:

An amstrong number is a number that is the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number digit.

## For example:

- **9** is an Amstrong number, because: **9 = 9^1 = 9**
- **10** is not and Amstrong number, because: **10 != 1^2 + 0^2 = 1**
- **153** is an Amstrong number, because: **153 = 1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153**
- **154** is not an Amstrong number, because: **154 != 1^3 + 5^3 + 4^3 = 190**

Write some code to determine if a number is an Amstrong number.
